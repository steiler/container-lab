With the growing number of containerized Network Operating Systems grows the demand to easily run them in the user-defined, versatile lab topologies.
A distinctive requirement of a container-based lab is the need for point-to-point interfaces interconnecting the elements.

Unfortunately, container orchestration tools like docker/podman/etc are not a good fit for that purpose, as they do not allow a user to easily create such p2p connections between the containers.

Containerlab provides a framework for setting up networking labs with containers. It starts the containers and builds a virtual wiring between them to create lab topologies of users choice.

Containerlab focuses on containerized Network Operating Systems which are typically used to test network features and designs, such as:

* [Nokia SR-Linux](https://www.nokia.com/networks/products/service-router-linux-NOS/)
* [Arista cEOS](https://www.arista.com/en/products/software-controlled-container-networking)
* [SONiC](https://azure.github.io/SONiC/)
* [Juniper cRPD](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/crpd/topics/concept/understanding-crpd.html)

But, of course, containerlab is perfectly capable of wiring up arbitrary containers which can host your network applications, virtual router or simply be a test client.

## Features
* **IaaC approach**  
    Declarative way of defining the labs by means of the [topology definition files](manual/topo-def-file.md).
* **Network Operating Systems centric**  
    Focus on containerized Network Operating Systems. The sophisticated startup requirements of various NOS containers are abstracted with [kinds](manual/kinds.md) which allows the user to focus on the use cases, rather than infrastructure.
* **Simplicity and convenience are keys**  
    One-click [installation](install.md) and upgrade capabilities.
* **Fast**  
    Blazing fast way to create container based labs on any Debian or RHEL system.
* **Automated TLS certificates provisioning**  
    The nodes which require TLS certs will get them automatically on start.
* **Documentation is a first-class citizen**  
    We do not let our users guess by making a complete, concise and clean [documentation](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev).
* **Lab catalog**  
   The "most-wanted" lab topologies are [documented and included](lab-examples/lab-examples.md) with containerlab installation. Based on this cherry-picked selection you can start crafting the labs answering your needs.
