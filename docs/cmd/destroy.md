# destroy command

### Description

The `destroy` command destroys a lab referenced by its [topology definition file](../manual/topo-def-file.md).

### Usage

`containerlab [global-flags] destroy [local-flags]`

**aliases:** `des`

### Flags

#### topology

With the global `--topo | -t` flag a user sets the path to the topology definition file that will be used get the elements of a lab that will be destroyed.

#### cleanup

The local `--cleanup` flag instructs containerlab to remove the lab directory and all its content.

Without this flag present, containerlab will keep the lab directory and all files inside of it.

Refer to the [configuration artifacts](../manual/conf-artifacts.md) page to get more information on the lab directory contents.

#### graceful
To make containerlab attempt a graceful shutdown of the running containers, add the `--graceful` flag to destroy cmd. Without it, containers will be removed forcefully without even attempting to stop them.

### Examples

```bash
# destroy a lab based on mylab.yml topology file located in the same dir
containerlab destroy -t mylab.yml

# destroy a lab and also remove the Lab Directory
containerlab destroy -t mylab.yml --cleanup
```
