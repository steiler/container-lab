# graph command

### Description

The `graph` command generates graphical representaitons of the deployed topology.

Two graph styles are available, using [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) or using a HTML page generated by `containerlab` based on a Go html template.

#### Graphviz

#### HTML

The HTML based graph is created by rendering a [GoHTML](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) template against a `struct` containing the topology name as well as a `json` string where 2 lists are present: `nodes` and `links` .

`nodes` contains data about the lab nodes, such as name, kind, type, image, state, IP addresses,...

`links` contains the list of links defined by source node and target node, as well as the endpoint names

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "node1-1",
      "image": "srlinux:20.6.1-286",
      "kind": "srl",
      "group": "tier-1",
      "state": "running/Up 21 seconds",
      "ipv4_address": "172.23.23.3/24",
      "ipv6_address": "2001:172:23:23::3/80"
    },
    // omitted rest of nodes
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "source": "node1-2",
      "source_endpoint": "e1-1",
      "target": "node2-1",
      "target_endpoint": "e1-2"
    },
    {
      "source": "node2-1",
      "source_endpoint": "e1-4",
      "target": "node3-1",
      "target_endpoint": "e1-1"
    },
    // omitted rest of links 
  ]
}
```

Within the template Javascript libraries such as  [**d3js directed force graph**](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-force) or [**vis.js network**](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/) can be used to generate custom topology graphs.

`containerlab` comes with a (minimalistic) default template using [d3js](https://github.com/d3/d3-force).

After the graph generation, it allows to freely move the nodes to a desired position then export the graph in PNG format

### Usage

`containerlab [global-flags] graph [local-flags]`

### Flags

#### name

With the global `--name | -n` flag a user sets the name of the lab that will be graphed.

#### srv

The `--srv` flag enables the HTML graph representation if present, it specifies an address a http server will listen to.

A single path `/` is served, where the graph is generated based on either a default template or on the template supplied using `--template`

#### template

The `--template` flag allows to customize the HTML based graph by supplying a user defined template that will be rendered and exposed on the address specified by `--srv`


### Examples

```bash

# generate topo1 graph using Graphviz
containerlab graph --topo /path/to/topo1.yaml

# start an http server on :3002 where topo1 graph will be rendered using the default template
containerlab graph --topo /path/to/topo1.yaml --srv ":3002"

# start an http server on :3002 where topo1 graph will be rendered using a custom template my_template.html
containerlab graph --topo /path/to/topo1.yaml --srv ":3002" --template my_template.html
```
